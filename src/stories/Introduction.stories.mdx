# Harbour.Space Design System

### _Shape the user experience when they interact with the [Harbour.Space](https://harbour.space/) core products (Students + Teachers + Staff)_.

The system aims to expand knowledge, and act as a repository for new, old features, elements, UI kits, Accessibility and Design guides, and coding infrastructure for multiple devices. It is important to make this cohesive across all platforms, and for different uses from different perspectives, such as Teachers/Students, Staff members, and prospective students and investors.

<br />

> **What is included in the Harbour.Space ecosystem**:
> Web, internal platform, students and teachers space.

## CORE PRINCIPLES üß≠

### **Purposefulness**:

1. Meaning: Every element in the project has to have an intentional purpose.¬†Designers have to have an explanation for every decision made and every process choosen, therefore, should be able to explain what each element is and why it's there.
2. Why this principle: Although some elements can be beautiful and visually appealing, they aren‚Äôt relevant to the product and can cause the adverse effect of deterring a user away from the intended actions they should be taking. Therefore, if there is no intention behind the design or element, there is no use for it in the project.

<br />

### **Friendly Language**:

1. Calculated and fact based language can appear cold and distrusting, disconnecting the user from a personalized experience with the platforms. It is important to maintain a professional and educational tone while creating a friendly and connected atmosphere.
2. UX writing is very important and can make or break an user interaction within a design system. The semantics of the words used alter and impact the choices a user makes. Encouraging and enticing language is great as long as it is not overbearing to the user.

<br />

### **Less is more**:

1. Elements in the design system should only solve problems the system is currently facing or trying to solve.
2. Legibility of all components is very important to allow multiple users and different teams t
   1. Ensure that it‚Äôs legible
   2. Always prioritize the issues that need to be addressed from high priority to low, and focus on the high priority tasks.
   3. Build it to scale from simple use case to complicated use case.
3. Ensure that all components and elements are direct and are comprehensible, the more clean and consistent the design system is, the easier it will be to navigate.

<br />

### **Everything should be registered**:

1. Everything should be written down and documented, to ensure that all updates and assets can be accessed and understood.
2. As components, elements and code continue to be built and programmed, explanations and notes of everything should be added to the system, so that additional internal team members can comprehend and understand the navigation and elements.

## VOICE AND TONE üé≠

### **Voice and Tone**

Educational, informative, and Assertive, straight to the point, Meant to target the tech savvy consumer who is looking to grow and develop their skills.. Should always sound like Harbour.Space-

**Harbour space‚Äôs voice:**
A state of the art educational institute who wants to help those with an interest in the tech, design, and startup world, grow, develop, and become industry leaders through education. This should be the first thing someone who uses our products understands.

The tools created here will guide and aid the users to get the jobs done. It is important to consider that there are different types of users that have different needs from our products. The tone should be adapted to cater to the different needs, while still maintaining Harbour Space tone.

### **Harbour Space‚Äôs Voice should be**

**Educational and informative**:
Use formal and direct language without seeming overly excited.

- Always take accountability and an carry honest and helpful approach
- Communicate with empathy. Users want to feel a sense of connection to the product, and empathy can provide that.
- Do not approach with leading language.

> Do‚Äôs:
> ‚ÄúExplore new roles, context, and approaches for this program, here you will analyse, prototype, and design concepts in social and cultural contexts.‚Äù

<br />

> Dont‚Äôs:
> ‚ÄúIf you take this program, you are guaranteed a job right away.‚Äù

<br />

**Be Energetic and motivating:**
The users, teachers, Prospective students, and students want to feel respected and inspired.

- Use wording that is catered towards the individual user experience, making them feel heard and understood, while promoting a bright and exciting career and future.
- Always use words and language that promote call to action, and more movements in the page.

> Do‚Äôs:
> ‚ÄúScholarships available for the world‚Äôs top talents. Do you have what it takes?‚Äù
>
> Or
>
> ‚ÄúApply now!"

<br />

> Donts:
> "Apply but only if you are interested". This does not encourage or guides the students and users to a call to action.

<br />

**Act as a support and guide:**
We want the students and teachers to feel like their future is in their hands. That we are here to simply be the stepping stone for their own educational growth journey.

- Highlighting the growth factor and situations they can have.
- Use helpful language when communicating directly with the users. ‚ÄúHow can I help you‚Äù, ‚Äú how can we make this experience better for you‚Äù. This is meant to be a safe space for the user.
- In Student experience guides, use fun, warm, and exciting language that also remains direct. In the lifestyle aspects, the user wants to feel like they are talking to a personalized travel guide here to make their experience smoother and warmer.

> Do‚Äôs:
> ‚ÄúWe are delighted to introduce some of our excellent teachers. Keep track of more updates on Twitter and Facebook.‚Äù

<br />

> Dont‚Äôs:
> ‚ÄúOur teachers are better than what you were getting at your old school.‚Äù This sounds condescending and putting the intended user down.

<br />

**Tone can adapt to different situations:**

- Never adopt the tone towards individualistic cases as this can deter the user from the products in the future. We do not want to be in the position to assume their mindset or intentions and vocalize that to them. People often do not want to be told these things.
- Do not use overly complicated and or intimidating language.
- Things must be straight to the point and kind.
- Some people want to be guided step by step through situations:
  > Do: Help people understand why they should do something. <br />
  > Don't: Oversell or over-promise.<br />
  > Do: be prescriptive about how someone should use a feature.<br />
  > Motivate and encourage: Help understand the next steps.<br />
  > Don't assume the next step is a guaranteed outcome.<br />
  > Problems + errors:

## ACCESSIBILITY ‚ôøÔ∏è

### **Information Architecture**

- Structuring labeling content in an effective and sustainable way. When you are creating an app part of the student/teacher hub, or website, make content usable and findable.
- Simplify complexity: info should be structured in the most simple way
- Support scalability: avoid overhauling previous work whenever the product grows or changes
- Create familiarity: should always feel like the same product. Common experience goes beyond the design and goes to how content is structured.

<br />

All screens should have good navigation, a maximum of three clicks to get to where the user needs to be.

- Avoid information overload. By gradually revealing information as requested.
- Provide multiple access points to information.
- Eliminate redundant content.
- By doing this we give users a direct choice to avoid frustration and confusion with too much detail.

<br />

Things are always in flux, with new updates and developments, and user needs, are always ready to shift and evolve with the product. Scalable approach.

- Communication with the team refers to statistics and research.
- Think about the future of the project.
